That said, if you don't want to do that, I'd suggest Elec->Electro as it goes with electroweb and electroball which we use even in pm19. Also, kind of odd to be stuck up on THIS particular engrish when the exact same sentence uses "Elec Field" adapted to Electric Field —Puto}{*looks up Kapu-Kokeko's ability*... It is never referenced by name outside of this one episode. So it probably doesn't even really MATTER all that much tbh. Yeah, might as well just leave it as Electro Maker to match the Electric Field that the dub somehow messed up by calling electric field in this episode. -Starfish}
