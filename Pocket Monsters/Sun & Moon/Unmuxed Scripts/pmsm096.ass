I guess we could match the JP by cutting out the first half of his sentence and just have "We are kindred spirits", but... "doushi no you desu ne" DOES still translate to "It seems we are kindred spirits". Which also incidentally means that his "douyara wareware wa" at the start of the line in episode 92 was, for all intents and purposes, padding out the sentence without adding anything to it!!!!! -Starfish OF THE FUTURE (who by the way did double-check that this matches the BD batch)}
